	<h1>Andaman and Nicobar Island</h1>
	<b>
	<p>The name Andaman might have been derived from Handuman, after the Indian God Hanuman from the Hindu epic Ramayana.[5] The place was called with a similar name by the Malays, who used to be involved in slave trade in the region.[6] The place was also referred by various names such as Angademan by Ptolemy in the 2nd century CE and Angamanian by Marco Polo in 13th century CE.[5] Nicobar, which was located in the sea route connecting South India to South East Asia, was known as Nakkavaram, meaning "open/naked land" borrowed from Tamil language which later became Nicobar.[7] In the middle ages (500-1500 AD), Nicobar was known as Lankhabatus in Arabia, probably a mis-transcription of the name Nakkavaram.</p>
